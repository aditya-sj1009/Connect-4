# Connect 4 Neural Network Game Environment and Training
This project showcases a Connect 4 game environment implemented using Python, along with the training of a neural network using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. The neural network is designed to learn optimal moves in the Connect 4 game.

## Features
Connect 4 Game Environment: The project provides a functional Connect 4 game environment, allowing players to interact and make moves on the game board.

Neural Network Training: We collected and pre-processed a dataset of game states and their corresponding optimal moves. Using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, we trained a neural network to predict these optimal moves based on the current game state.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): The neural network architecture employed is based on Artificial Neural Networks, enabling the model to learn the patterns and strategies for making effective moves in Connect 4.
